## A few points about the code:

- I have included the Tailwind CDN in the HTML file which I know is not best practice for production, but I used it in this case because it is just a small project.
- I have included the API key in JS code which, again, I know is not best practice in production because it is sensitive information and I should ideally use a backend, however since the task was to use vanilla JS and the API is not that sensitive in this case, I included it in the JS code.
- I did use AI for the Tailwind CSS because it speeds up time a lot and does a great job at it, allowing me to spend my time on the HTML and JS. I still understand the classes but I did not want to spend a long time tinkering with CSS.
